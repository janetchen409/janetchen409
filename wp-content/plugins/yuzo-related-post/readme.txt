### ✰ 🎈 3rd Party Service ✰
To improve the complement we are using an external service to obtain geolocation data. This data helps to obtain information of where the visitor of the post clicked,
that is, we make a visitor tracker. This helps the plugin in the future to have statistical data and visitor click information. To achieve this we use the serivioc of [freegeoip](https://freegeoip.app) That is a free and has high performance.

== Installation ==
This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.
